# GoTimeTracker
(Name pending)

Planned features:
- Track time spent on applications based on process, window name, or "project"  
  (such as how long you spent dawdling in ~/code/ :wink:)
- Squashing rules
  - Discord likes to notify you by showing (n) in the title when there's a
    notification, or some stupid fucking unicode bullet point when there isn't
    one...
  - Maybe you want to see how long you're spending on individual projects in
    ~/code, maybe you only care about how long you spend in the ~/code
    directory, or maybe you want both the details and a summary!
  - Or just track against the main process :shrug:
  - Host-based rules? (ssh)
- Web UI I guess
- Multi-monitor/unfocused window tracking?

I'll flip a coin later to decide if these are planned or unplanned features:
- Integrate with MyFirstToDoApp or something  
  Now you can procrastinate with stats!
- Daemon?
- ~~Invent some domain specific config language just as an excuse to write
  a parser for it, to add to my resume~~
- 3% chance of Wayland support.
  - Windows is probably going to be more likely(don't count on it)
  - Definitely don't count on support for fruit-flavoured OSs
